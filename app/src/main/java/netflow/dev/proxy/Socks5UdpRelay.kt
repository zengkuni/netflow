/**
 * SOCKS5 UDP ASSOCIATE relay (RFC 1928 §7).
 *
 * Listens on [listenAddress] for client UDP packets carrying a SOCKS5 UDP
 * header, forwards their payload to the actual destination over the cellular
 * network, then wraps and forwards replies back.
 *
 * One relay per TCP control connection. Only [clientAddress], the peer that
 * opened that control connection, may use it: this socket is never touched
 * by the TCP handshake, so without that check the relay is an unauthenticated
 * egress path onto the user's metered data for anyone on the LAN.
 *
 * The relay shuts down when [close] is called, when the TCP control closes,
 * when the proxy stops, or when either loop ends for any reason.
